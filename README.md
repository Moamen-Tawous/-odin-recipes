# Recipe Project

This is my first project in The Odin Project course, where I created a simple recipe website. The goal of this project is to practice the basics of HTML, including:

- Structuring a webpage
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Adding and formatting images

# Features:

- A collection of recipes with step-by-step instructions.
- Clean and minimal layout focused on usability.

# What I Learned:

- Building a webpage from scratch using only HTML.
- Organizing content effectively using semantic tags.
- Linking pages to create a multi-page website.
