      <li>1 pound boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir onion
        in hot oil until translucent, about 7 minutes. Mix in lamb, salt, and
        black pepper; cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 10 more
        minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in water and tomato sauce; season with salt and black pepper. Bring
        to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer lamb in sauce until very
        tender, at least 1 hour, adding more water as needed. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Stir okra into lamb mixture, adding more water if necessary, and bring
        to a boil. Spoon bamia into a 2-quart baking dish and adjust salt and
        black pepper; cover the dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until okra is tender, about 45 minutes;
        uncover for last 10 minutes of baking.
